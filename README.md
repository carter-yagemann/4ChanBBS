4Chan BBS
=========

About
-----

4Chan BBS is a Python project which allows users to browse the popular image board 
4Chan through a telnet connection and command line interface.

Why?
----

Do you remember the good old days of networked computing before GUI browsers existed?

I don't, I'm too young.

Regardless, I think it's time for old-school telnet BBS server to make a comeback. So 
with that in mind, I made a BBS server for the popular image board 4Chan! The server 
back-end communicates through 4Chan's API to provide real boards, threads, and posts 
in real time and presents this data to the user through a command line interface. No 
more pesky GUIs!

4Chan BBS even supports images by converting them into a more CLI friendly ASCII string format!

Installation
------------

The easiest way to setup 4Chan BBS is to install Python 3.8, PIP and libaa1. Install `libaa1`
with a command similar to `sudo apt install libaa1`.  Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
to get all the required libraries.

To start the server run `python Server.py`.

If you get an error while trying to install Pillow, you may have to download some 
additonal libraries using a command like `sudo apt-get build-dep python-imaging`.

Configuration
-------------

`config.py` includes all the configuration settings for the server.
