Does not having a cliche tsundere personality make you a slut? Is that what you\\u2019re saying? Because if you\\u2019re saying that I can assure you that you\\u2019re wrong. Why would you make this topic when the game is already finished and we know for certain she is pure? Luca has to go up against one of the sluttiest reyvateils in Ar Ciel who just happened to have a lead because she was praying on Croix&#039;s innocence. But you know what? Cloche is still a whore. Luca is the best heroine in all three games, she has the best songs. Luca has already won Croix over, she would have done it sooner if it wasn&#039;t for her tragedy with her sister throwing her for a mental loop. Maybe you should shut the fuck up before you make retarded topics like this. You know why? Because you&#039;re going to be embarrassed when Luca is proven a better waifu than any other in AT2. Cloche tries to latch on to anyone who would have shown her a different and free life. Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You are a fucking idiot and you should never make a topic on this board again and I\\u2019m fucking serious. I almost have a feeling you\\u2019re the only guy making all these anti-Luca topics because you\\u2019re a faggot hater who doesn\\u2019t like a heroine because they\\u2019re canonically pure.
